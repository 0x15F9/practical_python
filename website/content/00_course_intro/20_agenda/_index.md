In this course, we'll be covering the following topics:

#### 1. Why Python?

Why choose Python for your next project? What philosophies are behind Python's design principals? What problems are Python best suited for?

#### 2. Data Types

Python is a dynamic language. Learn how to work with variables and types in Python - numbers, strings, lists, and more.

#### 3. Sets, Tuples, Dictionaries

Focus on Python's advanced data types - tuple, dict and set. These are container objects that let us organize other types of objects into one data structure.

#### 4. Functions, Loops, and Logic

Functions help us organize our code in a way that’s reusable, and accept arguments and defaults where needed. Loops let us take action on collections of items. Boolean logic allows us to control the execution flow of our program.

#### 5. Practical Applications

Learn practical applications of what we’ve learned so far, including using advanced looping techniques like list comprehensions, converting between different types in Python, and how to work with files.

#### 6. Object Oriented Python

Object oriented programming allows us to represent our code in a different way.  Reusable classes allow us to define relationships between different types of objects and build modular, reusable code.

#### 7. Libraries and Modules

Now that you have a foundational understanding on how Python works, learn how to structure your code into modules and work with different libraries.

#### 8. Web Frameworks

In this final chapter, we’ll learn about web frameworks, and practice all our new Python knowledge by building a basic web application with unit tests and a database using Python.
